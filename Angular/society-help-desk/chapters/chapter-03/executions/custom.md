# Custom Status Label Pipe — Live Execution Detail

**Curriculum:** Chapter 03 → Pipes and custom pipes → Custom Status Label Pipe → Execution
**Status:** Interactive Angular example implemented in the shared Society Help Desk application; local compiler/browser verification still required.

## Problem and learner story
Convert internal status values into friendly labels with a pure custom pipe. We use fictional Society Help Desk data for the examples.

## Memory hook
**Custom pipe = your own formatter.**

## Open and execute the demo
1. From repository root, run:

       cd Angular/society-help-desk
       npm install
       npm run test:lab
       npm run build
       npm start

2. Open http://localhost:4200/chapters/03/pipes-and-custom-pipes/custom
3. **Try this:** Choose a raw complaint status.
4. **Expected result:** Status label changes, but the raw value remains unchanged.
5. Click Reset and repeat. Explain how the result changes.

## Relevant instructional code
This snippet comes from the Module 03 learning catalogue. The real executable implementation is in src/lab/, not in this Markdown document.

~~~typescript
<p>{{ status() | statusLabel }}</p>
// @Pipe({ name: 'statusLabel', standalone: true, pure: true })
~~~

## Beginner explanation
Convert internal status values into friendly labels with a pure custom pipe. The component has a changeable state and a template binding or an animation rule. When the learner acts on the control, Angular updates the rendered result above. Read the linked original lesson for all labs and variants.

## Practice, evidence and interview readiness
- [ ] Modify input and capture a before/after screenshot.
- [ ] Find the matching @case ('custom') in src/lab/lab-demo.html.
- [ ] Trace the event or input to lab-demo.ts or the custom pipe/directive file.
- [ ] Explain whether the change affects structure, styles, formatted text, or animation.
- [ ] Run npm run build successfully and record terminal evidence.
- [ ] Recall the memory hook without opening the guide.

**Note:** The actual app executes this demo; the Markdown explains it. The environment used to author this guide has not executed the Angular build or browser test.
